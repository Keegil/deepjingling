joyful time in the city
the reindeer loved him
a dead tomato so terrible
ring-a-ling, like a picking tiny tim

pilled my bright
down the stairs to thee 
and called with light
and still through his knee

we can build a merry christmas
fa la la la la la!
glory to the snowman
pa rum pum pum pum

you're a santa brinch
fa la la la la la!
hail! the heart poor young
pa rum pum pum pum

light of a seasick crocodiled bethlehem
bells on bob tail ring
christmas timez all the way
square in the stars are brightly shining

then all the winds of street
hate all word and nature sing
hear the time 
in the great seasick great king

we can build a merry christmas
fa la la la la la!
glory to the snowman
pa rum pum pum pum

you're a santa brinch
fa la la la la la!
hail! the heart poor young
pa rum pum pum pum

Outro...Thomas can jazz it out, sing it out or talk it as he wants. Pick some sentences, all or none. 

i saw mommy kissing scrooge
the perversed will never love 
grandma got run over by a rile-bag
struck the most heavenly sleigh tonight
said the savior, with jingle belling
underneath mistletoe hung for yourself
we're gliding around the chimney tonight
santa claus is coming to town
he's a dead for his hand
and comes tonight!
on the snow is the stove in grandma's wig



with their peal, is thy bright.
i'm dreaming of the fun i don't see,



joy from thy boy




like the heav'n and winfer,
and all of the flat people drives a swimming









it's beginning in a wintry heart
with a kiss will go
dressed up down glowing out selfish
you better say it was a heart.



heed our sheep
on a white christmas,
and more things like the glory given
in the village
he's been ringing a fire,
and crack!

heed our sheep
you're a santa brinch

with the person through the breathy winds

10 suffering in a winter wonderful time of the winter

everyrody drawn my seasick feeling
and when our soul will be birds


all is a little tiny carol 

with our holy breast in the plump at your christmas


and are the lids of children
and comfortable and heaven!

silent night, holy nicht!

santa's coming,
and talk of a pear tree

he will get a sentimental mother

we're riding in a wonderland of sight
we're snow and never really together

although the world can build a snowman
and parties falling out in the city

 




pa rum pum pum pum





all is grinding through the window

jingle around the caroling
you will get a sentimental feeling
when you're among the reindeer

he's got a bag they should reindeer



son of soldier reindeer

now the man is so married home upon the hot jack




santa baby, silver bells's bearing him,
much pleasure doves




at the christmas

we can build a merry christmas



santa baby, there's gray
the dark is slight
mirright,

strong and buy love of the day of christmas

6 swans a moment by a corn evening
as we pretend the instant prance

on the love reindeer
fall over by the snowman

we can make a greasy songs are saw from the holly
glorious slice
and lake someone was not a girl had been morning

oh life joy with the instant words in which it's been all around their baby

a man is seen
right for christmas
with every christmas
a sweet heart's goods

you'd not wish you a merry christmas

tribute on his secrets glisten



10 drummers reindeer

i'm dreaming of a reindeer
walkin' home repeat the light

on the finger wonderful time of the year

joy from thy boy

hear the time in the great seasick great king

once upon a time before the ghost

6 swans a snowman
0 swans a milking

we're hungry together like a holly
pa rum pum pum pum

upon the snow, there's dead mistletoe

grandma got dead, to make why, we watch their his brightness of all the trees

oh scrooge and the pear in night

the shepherds have a cleak iron certainly

jingle bell up in me

jingle bell up in me on the sixth night!
a merry christmas,
and a happy eel and bright mist.

they believe in the air

and comfy rudity and green

but the star
scrooge said sing

and new heart on his life
and time to the old night

you can say there's no such thing as swimming

it's the most wonderful time to the child;
with a broomstick in his bed

i'm dreaming of his love!
and checking it for love

in the flower print in every stories 
and tiny tim will be back again by the glory giddy
and loves her new year

poor heavenly punishment of rubbish
humbug, don't cry



all your heart's a swimming

their bills with the harvest window
there's a moment is a feeling

i'm telling you a merry christmas
with every christmas
