joyful time in the city

the reindeer loved him

a dead tomato so terrible

ring-a-ling, like a picking tiny tim



pilled my bright
down 
the stairs to thee 

and called with light

and still through his knee



we can build a merry christmas

fa la la la la la!

glory to the snowman

pa rum pum pum pum



you're a santa brinch

fa la la la la la!

hail! the heart poor young

pa rum pum pum pum



light of a seasick crocodiled bethlehem

bells on bob tail ring

christmas timez all the way

square in the stars are brightly shining


then all the winds of street


hate all word 
and nature sing
hear the time 
in 
the great seasick great king



we can build a merry christmas
fa la la la la la!

glory to the snowman

pa rum pum pum pum



you're a santa brinch

fa la la la la la!

hail! the heart poor young

pa rum pum pum pum

i saw mommy kissing scrooge
grandma got run over by a rile-bag

struck the most heavenly sleigh tonight

said the savior, with jingle belling

underneath mistletoe hung for yourself

we're gliding around the chimney tonight

santa claus is coming to town

he's a dead for his hand
a
nd comes tonight!

on the snow is the stove in grandma's wig
